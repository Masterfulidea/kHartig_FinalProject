1. There is a bug where you can die while respawning. It doesn't really impact gameplay other than 
having a laggy respawn sometimes.
2. The game can be pretty difficult (I'm not good at platformers). I've still beaten it a few times.
The goal is to obtain the core in the alien's den.
3. Presentation & design doc are here inside a folder.
