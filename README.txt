1. Solution is in a separate folder cause I was getting errors otherwise. Hope this works.
2. There is a bug where you can die while respawning. It doesn't really impact gameplay other than 
having a laggy respawn sometimes.
3. The game can be pretty difficult (I'm not good at platformers). I've still beaten it a few times.
The goal is to obtain the core in the alien's den.
